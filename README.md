# Python_programs
This repository contains, entry level python coded programs.
In the program, we have basic level of file handling to create a system for buying and selling products (in this case laptops) for certain store or dealership.
When the code is compiled, it reads data from a txt file and displays the avialable products. You can choose to buy or sell to increase or decrease the dealership's stocks and the changes are directly committed to the same txt file.
It is an easy python program to get started with file handling.
